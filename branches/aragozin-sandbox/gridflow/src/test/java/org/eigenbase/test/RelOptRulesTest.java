/**
 * Unit test for rules in {@link org.eigenbase.rel} and subpackages.
 *
 * <p>As input, the test supplies a SQL statement and a single rule; the SQL is
 * translated into relational algebra and then fed into a {@link
 * org.eigenbase.relopt.hep.HepPlanner}. The planner fires the rule on every
 * pattern match in a depth-first left-to-right preorder traversal of the tree
 * for as long as the rule continues to succeed in applying its transform. (For
 * rules which call transformTo more than once, only the last result is used.)
 * The plan before and after "optimization" is diffed against a .ref file using
 * {@link DiffRepository}.
 *
 * <p>Procedure for adding a new test case:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Add a new public test method for your rule, following the existing
 * examples. You'll have to come up with an SQL statement to which your rule
 * will apply in a meaningful way. See {@link SqlToRelTestBase} class comments
 * for details on the schema.
 * <li>Run the test. It should fail. Inspect the output in
 * RelOptRulesTest.log.xml; verify that the "planBefore" is the correct
 * translation of your SQL, and that it contains the pattern on which your rule
 * is supposed to fire. If all is well, check out RelOptRulesTest.ref.xml and
 * replace it with the new .log.xml.
 * <li>Run the test again. It should fail again, but this time it should contain
 * a "planAfter" entry for your rule. Verify that your rule applied its
 * transformation correctly, and then update the .ref.xml file again.
 * <li>Run the test one last time; this time it should pass.
 * </ol>
